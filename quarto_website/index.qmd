# Welcome!

### Computational Soft Matter at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de), [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en)

Our research focuses on the development and application of multiscale molecular simulations methods for
soft-condensed-matter materials. Current activities revolve around the development of computational
high-throughput screening methods from molecular dynamics, aimed at the generation of large databases of
thermodynamic properties.
Interfaces with recent machine-learning architectures help streamline and accelerate the process.
Further activities aim at improving dynamical properties of coarse-grained models.

- Multiscale modeling of soft and biomolecular materials
- Impact of coarse-graining on chemical-space exploration
- Physics-infused machine learning for molecular systems
