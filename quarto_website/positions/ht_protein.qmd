:::

A fully funded PhD position is available in the group of Prof. Tristan Bereau ([tristanbereau.com](https://tristanbereau.com)) at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Heidelberg University. We invite applications for a position at the intersection of multiscale modeling, high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning to efficiently explore the chemical space of thermodynamic properties. The project will focus on protein-ligand binding, estimating ligand-binding stability for large subsets of chemical space. The starting date is negotiable, preferably Fall 2023. The position includes funds for travel, visits, and publications. Both CPU and GPU computing resources are available.


**About the Role**

The successful candidate will focus on the development of methodologies and applications to explore the chemical space of thermodynamic properties. Our approach uses multiscale modeling, especially transferable coarse-grained models, to efficiently reduce and navigate chemical space. The project will focus on protein-ligand binding, with ample methodological development to help solve key challenges along the way.

Relevant group publications around multiscale chemical-space exploration:

```{ojs}
import {Plot} from "@mkfreeman/plot-tooltip"
import {map} from "@martien/ramda"

papers_r = FileAttachment("../data/all_papers.json").json()
n_columns = Object.entries(papers_r["doi"]).length
index_array = Array.from({length: n_columns}, (_, i) => i)
papers = map(i => map(x => x[i], papers_r), index_array)

function displayTable(papers_) {
    return Inputs.table(papers_, {
        columns: [
        "doi",
