:::

A fully funded postdoctoral position is available in the group of Prof. Tristan Bereau ([tristanbereau.com](https://tristanbereau.com)) at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Heidelberg University. We invite applications for a position at the intersection of generative deep learning and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The initial appointment will be for two years, with a possible extension of one year. The starting date is negotiable, preferably Fall 2023. The position is funded according to the German public service scale (TV-L E13) commensurate with experience. It includes funds for travel, visits, and publications. Both CPU and GPU computing resources are available.


**About the Role**

The successful candidate will focus on employing and advancing deep diffusion probabilistic machine learning techniques to understand and predict the behavior of molecular systems. Connections to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will play a central role.

Relevant group publications around generative learning, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics:

```{ojs}
import {Plot} from "@mkfreeman/plot-tooltip"
import {map} from "@martien/ramda"

papers_r = FileAttachment("../data/all_papers.json").json()
n_columns = Object.entries(papers_r["doi"]).length
index_array = Array.from({length: n_columns}, (_, i) => i)
papers = map(i => map(x => x[i], papers_r), index_array)

function displayTable(papers_) {
    return Inputs.table(papers_, {
        columns: [
        "doi",
        "title",
        "journal.name",
        "journal.volume",
        "year",
      ],
      header: {
        "journal.name": "journal",
        "journal.volume": "volume",
      },
      format: {
        doi: doi => htl.html`<a href=https://doi.org/${doi} target=_blank>${doi}</a>`,
        title: title => htl.html`${title}`,

        year: year => htl.html`${year}`,
      },
      width: {
        "title": 10
      },
      layout: "auto",
    })
}

displayTable(
    papers.filter(function(p) {
        return (
            p.authors.map(a => a.full_name).includes("Marc Stieffenhofer")
            || p.authors.map(a => a.full_name).includes("Marius Bause")
            || p.authors.map(a => a.full_name).includes("Kirill Shmilovich")
        )
    })
)
```

**About You**
