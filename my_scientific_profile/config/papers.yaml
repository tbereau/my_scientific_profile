    abstract: "The prosperity and lifestyle of our society are very much governed by achievements in condensed matter physics, chemistry and materials science, because new products for sectors such as energy, the environment, health, mobility and information technology (IT) rely largely on improved or even new materials. Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries, implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready' (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today. In this Perspective, we discuss how we can prepare to make this happen for the field of materials science."

    abstract: "Lipid asymmetry in plasma membrane of eukaryotes is ubiquitous. The first measurements reported compositional asymmetry: phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine are mostly on the cytoplasmic leafet, while phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin are mostly on the exoplasmic leaflet. More recent experiments using lipidomics have evidenced the presence of saturation asymmetry between the two leaflets. A question that naturally arises is why such an asymmetry? To complicate matters, it is still largely unknown in which leaflet cholesterol lies. Here, we use chemical potentials to mimic flippase proteins responsible for maintenance of compositional asymmetry in silico. We show that saturation asymmetry naturally arises as a byproduct of phospholipid number asymmetry and sphingomyelin contents, thereby showing that some reported asymmetries may naturally result from others and do not necessarily require being externally driven. We also show that plasmalogen lipids’ tendency to be highly unsaturated is also natural. Additionally, we tackle the problem of cholesterol and show that, while it is influenced by all asymmetries, the resulting cholesterol asymmetry tends to be fairly mild."

    abstract: "The plasma membrane is the interface between cells and exterior media. Although its existence has been known for a long time, organization of its constituent lipids remain a challenge. Recently, we have proposed that lipid populations may be controlled by chemical potentials of different lipid species, resulting in semigrand canonical thermodynamic ensembles. However, the currently available molecular dynamics software packages do not facilitate the control of chemical potentials at the molecular level. Here, we propose a variation of existing algorithms that efficiently characterizes and controls the chemical nature of each lipid. Additionally, we allow coupling with collective variables and show that it can be used to dynamically create asymmetric membranes. This algorithm is openly available as a plugin for the HOOMD-Blue molecular dynamics engine."

    abstract: "The lipid-raft hypothesis postulates that cell membranes possess some degree of lateral organization. The hypothesis has attracted much attention while remaining controversial, with an underlying mechanism that remains elusive. One idea that supports rafts relies on the membrane lying near a critical point. Although supported by experimental evidence, holding a many-component membrane at criticality requires a delicate tuning of all components—a daunting task. Here, we propose a coherent framework to reconcile critical behavior and lipid regulation. Using a lattice model, we show that lipid regulation of a complex membrane, i.e., allowing composition to fluctuate based on relative chemical potentials, can lead to critical behavior. The results are robust against specific values of the chemical potentials. Instead of a conventional transition point, criticality is observed over a large temperature range. This surprising behavior arises from finite-size effects, causing nonequivalent time and space averages. The instantaneous lipid distribution effectively develops a translational symmetry, which we relate to long-wavelength Goldstone modes. The framework is robust and reproduces important experimental trends; membrane-demixing temperature closely follows cell-growth temperature. It also ensures criticality of fixed-composition extracts, such as giant plasma membrane vesicles. Our clear picture provides a strong argument in favor of the critical-membrane hypothesis, without the need for specific sensing mechanisms."

    abstract: "Cell membranes mainly consist of lipid bilayers with an actively regulated composition. The underlying processes are still poorly understood, in particular, how the hundreds of components are controlled. Cholesterol has been found to correlate with phospholipid saturation for reasons that remain unclear. To better understand the link between cell membrane regulation and chemical composition, we establish a computational framework based on chemical reaction networks, resulting in multiple semigrand canonical ensembles. By running computer simulations, we show that regulating the chemical potential of lipid species is sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed increase in acyl tail saturation with added cholesterol. Our model proposes a different picture of lipid regulation in which components can be regulated passively instead of actively. In this picture, phospholipid acyl tail composition naturally adapts to added molecules such as cholesterol or proteins. A comparison between regulated membranes with commonly studied ternary model membranes shows stark differences: for instance, correlation lengths and viscosities observed are independent of lipid chemical affinity."

    abstract: "Small solutes have been shown to alter the lateral organization of cell membranes and reconstituted phospholipid bilayers; however, the mechanisms by which these changes happen are still largely unknown. Traditionally, both experiment and simulation studies have been restricted to testing only a few compounds at a time, failing to identify general molecular descriptors or chemical properties that would allow extrapolating beyond the subset of considered solutes. In this work, we probe the competing energetics of inserting a solute in different membrane environments by means of the potential of mean force. We show that these calculations can be used as a computationally efficient proxy to establish whether a solute will stabilize or destabilize domain phase separation. Combined with umbrella-sampling simulations and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to screen solutes across a wide range of chemistries and polarities. Our results indicate that for the system under consideration, preferential partitioning and therefore effectiveness in altering membrane phase separation are strictly linked to the location of insertion in the bilayer (i.e., midplane or interface). Our approach represents a fast and simple tool for obtaining structural and thermodynamic insight into the partitioning of small molecules between lipid domains and its relation to phase separation, ultimately providing a platform for identifying the key determinants of this process."

    abstract: "Polydispersity and random sequences are ubiquitous features of polymers, and molecular dynamics simulations can help elucidate the impact of disorder in polymer systems. However, currently available packages for building polymer topologies do not enable the user to include randomness in a straightforward fashion. Here, we introduce Hoobas, a molecular builder package that easily handles polydispersity using a prototype-builder design pattern. This enables fast and easy building of systems comprised of thousands of distinct objects. It is written in the Python programming language, which ensures compatibility with a wide range of molecular dynamics packages and tools, as well as easy integration into most workflows."

    abstract: "The determination of potentials of mean force for solute insertion in a lipid membrane by means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is often hampered by sampling issues. Recently, a multiscale method has been proposed to leverage the conformational ensemble of a lower-resolution model as starting point for higher resolution simulations. In this work, we analyze the efficiency of this method by comparing its predictions for propanol insertion into a lipid membrane against conventional atomistic umbrella sampling simulation results. The multiscale approach is confirmed to provide accurate results with a gain of one order of magnitude in computational time. We then investigate the role of the coarse-grained representation. We find that the accuracy of the results is tightly connected to the presence of a good configurational overlap between the coarse-grained and atomistic models—a general requirement when developing multiscale simulation methods."

    abstract: "The paradox of biomimetic research is to perform bio-functionality, usually associated with sophisticated structures optimized by nature, with minimal structural complexity for the ease of fabrication. Here we show that a three-particle trimer can exhibit kinesin-like autonomous walk on a track via reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The autonomous motion is due to imbalanced transitions resulting from exothermic catalytic reactions, and the spatial asymmetry from the track. This molecular design can be realized by reproducing the particle–particle interactions in functionalized nano- or colloidal particles. Our results open up the possibility of fabricating bio-mimetic nano-systems in a minimalist approach."

    abstract: "The parametrization of coarse-grained (CG) simulation models for molecular systems often aims at reproducing static properties alone. The reduced molecular friction of the CG representation usually results in faster, albeit inconsistent, dynamics. In this work, we rely on Markov state models to simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide force fields—one top-down and one bottom-up. Instead of a rigorous evolution of CG dynamics (e.g., using a generalized Langevin equation), we attempt to improve the description of kinetics by simply altering the existing CG models, which employ standard Langevin dynamics. By varying masses and relevant force-field parameters, we can improve the timescale separation of the slow kinetic processes, achieve a more consistent ratio of mean-first-passage times between metastable states, and refine the relative free-energies between these states. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of kinetic information into a structure-based parametrization improves the description of the helix-coil transition sampled by a minimal CG model. While structure-based models understabilize the helical state, kinetic constraints help identify CG models that improve the ratio of forward/backward timescales by effectively hindering the sampling of spurious conformational intermediate states."

    abstract: "The thermodynamics of insertion of a protein in a membrane depends on the fine interplay between backbone and side-chain contributions interacting with the lipid environment. Using computer simulations, we probe how different descriptions of the backbone glycyl unit affect the thermodynamics of insertion of individual residues, dipeptides, and entire transmembrane helices. Due to the lack of reference data, we first introduce an efficient methodology to estimate atomistic potential of mean force (PMF) curves from a series of representative and uncorrelated coarse-grained (CG) snapshots. We find strong discrepancies between two CG models, Martini and PLUM, against reference atomistic PMFs and experiments. Atomistic simulations suggest a weak free energy of insertion between water and a POPC membrane for the glycyl unit, in overall agreement with experimental results despite severe assumptions in our calculations. We show that refining the backbone contribution in PLUM significantly improves the PMF of insertion of the WALP16 transmembrane peptide. An improper balance between the glycyl backbone and the attached side chain will lead to energetic artifacts, rationalizing Martini’s overstabilization of WALP’s adsorbed interfacial state. It illustrates difficulties associated with free-energy-based parametrizations of single-residue models, as the relevant free energy of partitioning used for force-field parametrization does not arise from the entire residue but rather the solvent-accessible chemical groups."

    abstract: "Protein structure formation in the membrane highlights a grand challenge of sampling in computer simulations, because kinetic traps and slow dynamics make it difficult to find the native state. Exploiting increased fluctuations at higher temperatures can help overcome free-energy barriers, provided the membrane’s structure remains stable. In this work, we apply Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics, where we only tune the backbone hydrogen-bond strength to help reduce the propensity of long-lived misfolded states. Using a recently developed coarse-grained model, we illustrate the robustness of the method by folding different WALP transmembrane helical peptides starting from stretched, unstructured conformations. We show the efficiency of the method by comparing to simulations without enhanced sampling, achieving folding in one example after significantly longer simulation times. Analysis of the bilayer structure during folding provides insight into the local membrane deformation during helix formation as a function of chain length (from 16 to 23 residues). Finally, we apply our method to fold the 50-residue-long major pVIII coat protein (fd coat) of the filamentous fd bacteriophage. Our results agree well with experimental structures and atomistic simulations based on implicit membrane models, suggesting that our explicit CG folding protocol can serve as a starting point for better-refined atomistic simulations in a multiscale framework."

    abstract: "An extension of the multiple time-step integration following Kopf et al. (1997) for the Langevin thermostat and modified Ander- sen barostat is described. Proper isothermal and isobaric properties are validated on a Lennard-Jones liquid and a coarse-grained peptide-lipid model. Measurements of the configurational temperature indicate proper canonical sampling, while folding simu- lations of unstructured peptides into transmembrane helices provide a realistic application and suggest the maximum set of time steps usable for that model."

    abstract: "Multipole (MTP) electrostatics provides the means to describe anisotropic interactions in a rigorous and systematic manner. A number of earlier molecular dynamics (MD) implementations have increasingly relied on the use of molecular symmetry to reduce the (possibly large) number of MTP interactions. Here, we present a CHARMM implementation of MTP electrostatics in terms of spherical harmonics. By relying on a systematic set of reference-axis systems tailored to various chemical environments, we obtain an implementation that is both efficient and scalable for (bio)molecular systems. We apply the method to a series of halogenated compounds to show (i) energy conservation; (ii) improvements in reproducing thermodynamic properties compared to standard point-charge (PC) models; (iii) performance of the code; and (iv) better stabilization of a brominated ligand in a target protein, compared to a PC force field. The implementation provides interesting perspectives toward a dual PC/MTP resolution, à la QM/MM."

    abstract: "Two-state cooperativity is an important characteristic in protein folding. It is defined by a depletion of states that lie energetically between folded and unfolded conformations. There are different ways to test for two-state cooperativity; however, most of these approaches probe indirect proxies of this depletion. Generalized-ensemble computer simulations allow us to unambiguously identify this transition by a microcanonical analysis on the basis of the density of states. Here, we present a detailed characterization of several helical peptides obtained by coarse-grained simulations. The level of resolution of the coarse-grained model allowed to study realistic structures ranging from small α-helices to a de novo three-helix bundle without biasing the force field toward the native state of the protein. By linking thermodynamic and structural features, we are able to show that whereas short α-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate states. The helix bundle exhibits signs of two-state cooperativity owing to favorable helix-helix interactions, as predicted from theoretical models. A detailed analysis of secondary and tertiary structure formation fits well into the framework of several folding mechanisms and confirms features that up to now have been observed only in lattice models."

    abstract: "We propose a new algorithm for solving the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) equations to estimate free energies out of a set of Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The algorithm, based on free-energy differences, provides a more natural way of approaching the problem and improves convergence compared to the widely used direct iteration method. We also study how parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) of the independent simulations should be chosen to optimize the accuracy of the set of free energies."
